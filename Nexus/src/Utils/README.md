# Utilities

Utilities contain:

1. **Logger**: Logger has three functions, Log(), Warn() and Err() which print text to console in Green, Yellow and Red color respectively. It doesn't work in VS2022 because it is not a Console App but a Windows App but this works in Rider.
2. **Vector2**: A struct for two floats (x, y), along with some helper overloads for comparison and basic vector calculation.

# Ubisoft Next Project

This repository contains my project for the Ubisoft NEXT 2024-2025 Programming Challenge.

## Timeline

## Learning Resources

Books:

1. Game Programming Patterns (Robert Nystrom) - [Link](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/) ->
2. Game Engine Architecture, Third Edition (Jason Gregory) - [Link](https://www.gameenginebook.com/)

Online Texts:

1. A Simple Entity Component System (Austin Morlan) - [Link](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/) -> My ECS system is heavily inspired by this blog post. I am horrible at naming things so most my ECS class names are inspired form this.
2. Studyplan.dev - [Link](https://www.studyplan.dev/) -> My journey into C++ begins with this. Most of my knowledge about the basic and intermediate C++ came from this.
3. Nomad Game Engine: Part 7â€” The Event System (Niko Savas) - [Medium Link](https://medium.com/@savas/nomad-game-engine-part-7-the-event-system-45a809ccb68f) -> My event system is inspired from this blog post.
4. Architecture of System for Reading Input Devices Part 1 (Eugene Solyanov, posted by _Engine_) -> Was a good knowledge source when I was brainstorming the architecture of my Input System - [Link](https://www.gamedev.net/tutorials/programming/general-and-gameplay-programming/architecture-of-system-for-reading-input-devices-part-1-r4805/)

YouTube:

1. C++ and Game Engine video Series (The Cherno) - [Channel Link](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno) -> His channel inspired me to get in Game Engine Development
2. C++ Game Engine Infrastructure (ChiliTomatoNoodle) - [Channel Link](https://www.youtube.com/@ChiliTomatoNoodle) -> Helpful in setting up the project properties and C++ rulesets
3. Mike Acton "Data-Oriented Design and C++" - [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc&list=LL) -> I watched this video a couple of times but I still don't think I absorbed everything. This was my first step into Data-Oriented Design

Misc:

1. Unity Game Engine -> I am a bit familiar with game development using Unity3D and I have kept that in mind while developing this game engine. You can see the similarities in not only the code structure but also the naming.

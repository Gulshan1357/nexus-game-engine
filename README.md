## Learning Resources

### Books

1. **Game Programming Patterns (Robert Nystrom)**  
   - [Link](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)  

2. **Game Engine Architecture, Third Edition (Jason Gregory)**  
   - [Link](https://www.gameenginebook.com/) 

### Online Texts

1. **A Simple Entity Component System (Austin Morlan)**  
   - [Link](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/)  
   - *My ECS system is heavily inspired by this blog post. To be honest, I struggle with naming things, so most of my ECS class names are drawn directly from this.*  

2. **Studyplan.dev**  
   - [Link](https://www.studyplan.dev/)  
   - *My journey into C++ began here. Most of my basic and intermediate C++ knowledge comes from this site.*  

3. **Nomad Game Engine: Part 7—The Event System (Niko Savas)**  
   - [Medium Link](https://medium.com/@savas/nomad-game-engine-part-7-the-event-system-45a809ccb68f)  
   - *My event system is inspired by this blog post.*  

4. **Architecture of a System for Reading Input Devices Part 1 (Eugene Solyanov, posted by _Engine_)**  
   - [Link](https://www.gamedev.net/tutorials/programming/general-and-gameplay-programming/architecture-of-system-for-reading-input-devices-part-1-r4805/)  
   - *This article provided useful info while brainstorming the architecture of my input system.*
  
5. **Coding a 2D physics engine from scratch — and using it to simulate a pendulum clock (William Seymour)**  
   - [Link](https://medium.com/@www.seymour/coding-a-2d-physics-engine-from-scratch-and-using-it-to-simulate-a-pendulum-clock-964b4ac2107a)  
   - *In this article, I found the equation to calculate the Impulse imparted by the collision, and subsequently its effect on the linear and angular velocity.*

6. **Equality Constraints (Hubert Eichner)**  
   - [Link](https://web.archive.org/web/20211022100314mp_/http://myselph.de/gamePhysics/equalityConstraints.html)  
   - *This article contains equations and the derivation for the Joint Constaint.*

7. **Video Game Physics Tutorial - Part III: Constrained Rigid Body Simulation (Nilson Souto)**  
   - [Link](https://www.toptal.com/game/video-game-physics-part-iii-constrained-rigid-body-simulation)  
   - *In this article, I found the equation to calculate the Jacobian matrix to calculate correctional impulse.*

8. **Computing tensor of Inertia in 2D (StackOverFlow)**  
   - [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41592034/computing-tensor-of-inertia-in-2d/41618980#41618980)  
   - *In this article, I found the equation to calculate the Moment of inertia for convex polygons.*

### YouTube

1. **C++ and Game Engine Video Series (The Cherno)**  
   - [Channel Link](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno)

3. **Mike Acton: "Data-Oriented Design and C++"**  
   - [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc&list=LL)  
   - *I’ve watched this video multiple times but still feel there’s more to absorb. It was my first step into data-oriented design.*

4. **The Cherno: "Making a PARTICLE SYSTEM in ONE HOUR! (NO ENGINES)"**  
   - [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK0jHlv3e3w&t=268s)  
   - *This video was super helpful while I was building the particle effect system.*

5. **The Cherno: "CAMERAS and How They Work | Game Engine series"**
